This project is Astro-PrePreProc, a script to monitor a drop-box repository for astrophotographic data files coming in from multiple cameras. It implements a framework for customized processing of files either as they arrive or are modified (event-driven) or in scheduled batch operations. 

Language: Python, with YAML configuration file(s)
Style Preferences: Code should be easy to read, and should favor understandability over brevity. Clever hacks and obscure operations should be minimized. Functions should all include top-level comments that outline their behavior, parameters, and expected results.
Project Standards: This should be a test-driven development project. We should define tests for each function before implementing them, so we can readily confirm whether things work or not.
